Resuming a DR Task
==================

A fault may occur during DR due to external factors, such as insufficient storage space.

.. note::

   -  If a DR task fails due to non-network problems, the system will automatically resume the task three times by default. If the failure persists, you can resume the task manually.
   -  If the DR task fails due to network problems, the system will automatically resume the task until the task is restored.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have logged in to the DRS console.
-  A failed DR task exists.

Method 1

In the task list on the **Disaster Recovery Management** page, locate the target task and click **Resume** in the **Operation** column.

Method 2
--------

#. On the **Disaster Recovery Management** page, click the target DR task in the **Task Name/ID** column.
#. On the displayed page, click the **Migration Progress** tab, and click **Resume** in the upper left corner.
