Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have logged in to the DRS console.
-  For details about the DB types and versions supported by real-time synchronization, see :ref:`Real-Time Synchronization <drs_01_0302>`.

Suggestions
-----------

.. caution::

   -  When a task is being started or in the full synchronization phase, do not perform DDL operations on the source database. Otherwise, the task may be abnormal.
   -  To keep data consistency before and after the synchronization, ensure that no data is written to the destination database during the synchronization.

-  The success of database synchronization depends on environment and manual operations. To ensure a smooth synchronization, perform a synchronization trial before you start the synchronization to help you detect and resolve problems in advance.

-  Start your synchronization task during off-peak hours. A less active database is easier to synchronize successfully. If the data is fairly static, there is less likely to be any severe performance impacts during the synchronization. If you have to synchronize data during peak hours, you can select **Yes** for **Flow Control** to adjust the synchronization speed.

   -  If network bandwidth is not limited, the query rate of the source database increases by about 50 MB/s during full synchronization, and two to four CPUs are occupied.
   -  To ensure data consistency, tables to be synchronized without a primary key may be locked for 3s.
   -  The data being synchronized may be locked by other transactions for a long period of time, resulting in read timeout.
   -  Due to the inherent characteristics of MySQL, in certain scenarios the performance may be negatively affected. For example, if the CPU resources are insufficient and the storage engine is TokuDB, the read speed on tables may be decreased by 10%.
   -  When DRS concurrently reads data from a database, it will use about 6 to 10 sessions. The impact of the connections on services must be considered.
   -  If you read a table, especially a large table, during the full migration, the exclusive lock on that table may be blocked.

-  Data-Level Comparison

   To obtain accurate comparison results, :ref:`compare data <drs_10_0012>` at a specified time point during off-peak hours. If it is needed, select **Start at a specified time** for **Comparison Time**. Due to slight time difference and continuous operations on data, data inconsistency may occur, reducing the reliability and validity of the comparison results.

-  For many-to-one synchronization tasks that involve the synchronization of the same table, DDL operations cannot be performed on source databases. Otherwise, all synchronization tasks fail.

Precautions
-----------

Before creating a synchronization task, read the following notes:

.. note::

   -  You are advised to create an independent database account for DRS task connection to prevent task failures caused by account modification.
   -  After changing the account passwords for the source or destination databases, :ref:`modify the connection information <drs_10_0016>` in the DRS task as soon as possible to prevent automatic retry after a task failure. Automatic retry will lock the database accounts.

   |                                   | -  The destination DB instance is running properly. If the destination DB instance type is primary/standby, the replication status must also be normal.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
   |                                   | -  The destination DB instance must have sufficient storage space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   |                                   | -  If the destination database (excluding MySQL system database) has the same name as the source database, the table structures in the destination database must be consistent with those in the source database.                                                                                                                                          |
   |                                   | -  The character set of the destination database must be the same as that of the source database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   |                                   | -  The time zone of the destination database must be the same as that of the source database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
   |                                   | -  During a synchronization, a large amount of data is written to the destination database. If the value of the **max_allowed_packet** parameter of the destination database is too small, data cannot be written. You are advised to set the **max_allowed_packet** parameter to a value greater than 100 MB.                                             |
   |                                   | -  If the MyISAM tables are included in the synchronization objects, the **sql_mode** parameter in the destination database cannot contain the **no_engine_substitution** parameter. Otherwise, the synchronization fails.                                                                                                                                 |
   |                                   | -  The source database names mapped to the destination database cannot contain the following characters: dots (.), angle brackets (<>), backslash (\\), and single quotation marks (')                                                                                                                                                                     |
   +-----------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Precautions                       | -  Objects that have dependencies must be synchronized at the same time to avoid synchronization failure. Common dependencies: tables referenced by views, views referenced by views, views and tables referenced by stored procedures/functions/triggers, and tables referenced by primary and foreign keys                                               |
   |                                   | -  Only MySQL to MySQL synchronization supports many-to-one synchronization. During table-level many-to-one synchronization, tables without primary keys cannot exist in the source database.                                                                                                                                                              |
   |                                   | -  If the source or destination MySQL database does not support TLS 1.2 or is a self-built database of an earlier version (earlier than 5.6.46 or between 5.7 and 5.7.28), you need to submit an O&M application for testing the SSL connection.                                                                                                           |
   |                                   | -  Resumable upload is supported, but data may be repeatedly inserted into a table that does not have a primary key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
   |                                   | -  The destination table can contain more columns than the source table. However, the following failures must be avoided:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
   |                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
   |                                   |    -  Assume that extra columns on the destination cannot be null or have default values. If newly inserted data records are synchronized from the source to the destination, the extra columns will become null, which does not meet the requirements of the destination and will cause the task to fail.                                                 |
   |                                   |    -  Assume that extra columns on the destination must be fixed at a default value and have a unique constraint. If newly inserted data records are synchronized from the source to the destination, the extra columns will contain multiple default values. That does not meet the unique constraint of the destination and will cause the task to fail. |

   |                                   | -  The source database does not support point-in-time recovery (PITR).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
   |                                   | -  The destination database cannot be restored to a point in time when a full synchronization was being performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
   |                                   | -  Cascade operations cannot be performed on tables with foreign keys. If the foreign key index of a table is a common index, the table structure may fail to be created. You are advised to use a unique index.                                                                                                                                           |
   |                                   | -  Binlogs cannot be forcibly deleted. Otherwise, the synchronization task fails.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   |                                   | -  The source database does not support the **reset master** or **reset master to** command, which may cause DRS task failures or data inconsistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
   |                                   | -  Set the **expire_log_day** parameter to a proper value to ensure that the binlog does not expire before data transfer resumes. This ensures that services can be recovered after interruption.                                                                                                                                                          |
   |                                   | -  After a task is created, the destination database cannot be set to read-only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
   |                                   | -  A real-time synchronization task may fail due to the change of the username and password of the source or destination database. If it happens, rectify the information and then retry the synchronization task on the DRS console. Generally, you are advised not to modify the preceding information during synchronization.                           |
   |                                   | -  If the source or destination database port is changed during data synchronization, the synchronization task fails. You can rectify the fault as follows:                                                                                                                                                                                                |

   .. note::

      If a task fails to be created, DRS retains the task for three days by default. After three days, the task automatically ends.

#. On the **Configure Source and Destination Databases** page, wait until the synchronization instance is created. Then, specify source and destination database information and click **Test Connection** for both the source and destination databases to check whether they have been connected to the synchronization instance. After the connection tests are successful, select the check box before the agreement and click **Next**.

#. After the task is submitted, you can view and manage it on the **Data Synchronization Management** page.

   -  You can view the task status. For more information about task status, see :ref:`Task Statuses <drs_06_0004>`.
   -  You can click |image1| in the upper-right corner to view the latest task status.
   -  By default, DRS retains a task in the **Configuration** state for three days. After three days, DRS automatically deletes background resources, but the task status remains unchanged. When you reconfigure the task, DRS applies for resources for the task again.
