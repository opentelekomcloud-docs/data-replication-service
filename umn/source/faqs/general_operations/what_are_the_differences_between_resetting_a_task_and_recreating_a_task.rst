What Are the Differences Between Resetting a Task and Recreating a Task?
========================================================================

You can reset a task when the task is suspended or fails. Resetting a task does not clear the destination database. You can determine whether to clear the destination database based on your requirements. After the task is reset, a full synchronization is performed again. You do not need to configure the task again.
