Resuming a Migration Task
=========================

A fault may occur during the migration due to external factors, such as insufficient storage space. After the fault is rectified based on the migration log information, you can resume the migration.

You can resume migration tasks in any of the following statuses:

-  Migration failed
-  Paused

.. note::

   -  If a migration task fails due to non-network problems, the system will automatically resume the task three times by default. If the failure persists, you can resume the task manually.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  You have logged in to the DRS console.
-  A failed migration task exists.

Method 1
--------

On the **Online Migration Management** page, locate the target task and click **Resume** in the **Operation** column.

Method 2
--------

#. In the task list on the **Online Migration Management** page, locate and click the task.
#. On the displayed page, click the **Migration Progress** tab, and click **Resume** in the upper left corner.
