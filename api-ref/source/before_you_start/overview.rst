Overview
========

Welcome to Data Replication Service (DRS). DRS is a stable, secure, and efficient cloud service for online database migration and real-time database synchronization. You can create a migration task to migrate data from a source database to a destination database.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations in DRS, such as creating, querying, obtaining, and deleting resources. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <drs_02_0004>`.

To access DRS through an API, ensure that you are familiar with DRS concepts. For details, see **Product Introduction** in *Data Replication Service User Guide*.
