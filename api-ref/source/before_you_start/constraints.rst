===========

-  The number of DRS tasks that you can create cannot exceed your quota.
-  APIs can be called only in migration and synchronization from MySQL to MySQL databases, synchronization from MySQL to GaussDB(for MySQL) primary/standby, synchronization from PostgreSQL to PostgreSQL databases, and migration from MongoDB to DDS databases. For scenarios in open beta testing, problems may occur during the use of APIs. Exercise caution when calling APIs.
